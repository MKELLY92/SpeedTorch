# SpeedTorch
Library for fastest pinned CPU -> GPU transfer 

## What is it?

This library revovles around Cupy memmaps pinned to CPU, which can achieve _ % faster CPU -> GPU transfer than regular Pytorch Pinned CPU tensors can. 

## Why is it?

I initially created this library to help train large numbers of embeddings, which the GPU may have trouble holding in RAM. In order to do this, I found that by hosting some of the
